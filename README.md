# Flutter Pet Adoption App

This application was inspired by the amazing David Rodríguez's app design, avaliable on [Behance](https://www.behance.net/gallery/99826055/Faund-Pet-Adoption-App-Design).

This is the final UI. The navigatión across all the screen can be made just clicking in the assigned widget.

The backend part is still beign evaluated.
